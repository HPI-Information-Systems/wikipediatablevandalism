Rayna and a werewolf toxin-saturated Damon coax Stefan to do the mark transfer who eventually sets off on a run from Rayna. Damon is struggling with the werewolf toxin in his system and contemplating on whether he should participate for the mark transfer (as he will die when Rayna does naturally in another 60-70 years ergo, bidding goodbye to his chance of seeing Elena ever again) or come up with a better plan. In the meanwhile, Valerie comes to his rescue; over the past three years - her and Stefan's friendship has seen evolution and while globe-trotting, they have managed to contact an individual who may know ways to end Rayna.
